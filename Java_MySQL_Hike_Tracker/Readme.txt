# Java MySQL Hike Tracker Project 1

I built a program that integrates with a MySQL database that allows the user to enter in the Name, State, Miles, Date, and Difficulty from 1(easy) to 5 (difficult) of hikes that the user has completed, or plans to complete. There are three buttons called "add", "edit", and "delete", which grant the user the ability to customize the hike tracker record table with ease.

This project requires the user to have a MySQL database with MySQL connector and / or XAMPP utilization - If you would like a tutorial on how to do this project yourself, check out my YouTube video "Java MySQL Sample Project Walkthrough 2024": https://youtu.be/_UOmiZmgSGo
