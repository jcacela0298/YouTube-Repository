# Java MySQL Travel Planner Program

I built a program that integrates with a MySQL database that allows the user to enter in the destination, departure date, return date, and budget within a travel planner. There are three buttons called "add", "edit", and "delete" which grant the user the ability to customize the travel planner record table with ease.

This project requires the user to have a MySQL database with MySQL connector and / or XAMPP utilization - If you would like a tutorial on how to do this project yourself, check out my YouTube video "Java MySQL Sample Project Walkthrough 2024": https://youtu.be/_UOmiZmgSGo
